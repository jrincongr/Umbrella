# Umbrella
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and memorable.
It is called the Umbrella project because of the idea of making something better without changing it. (when it rains, you pull up your Umbrella to make it better but it is still raining.)

## Client Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the webpage meets accessibility standards, I will work on its code, making it beter, cleaner, readable, and beautifull.
WHEN I view the source code, I found it hard to read because it wasnt comented, had some bugs, and it was preatty messy, so I started by cleaning it, and commenting it in order to make it easyer for me to work on it, and easyer for enyone to work with it in the future.
THEN I find semantic HTML elements to be mising, so I change that inserted them and change them, in order to have a cleener and more organized HTML document.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, I noticed that it was preaty messy, so I cleaned up and gave them the proper structure.
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, were repiting a lot of so I resume them to give the document a more logical way to reed the styles and faster.
WHEN I view the image elements, those were not all correct, so I gave them the proper structure.
THEN I find accessible alt attributes, there were no alt attibutes so I inserted them in order to make it more interactive to every person in the world, no matter the dissabilitty she might have.
WHEN I view the heading attributes, they had bugs and were really poor, and all messed up so I cleaned and I inserted more links and atributes in order to make a great webpage.
THEN they fall in sequential order, in order to reach the perfect structurization that we want.
WHEN I view the title element, I just laughed, but I saw it and got it right.
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title and put it in to the "title" atribute.
I also found some missing and really important ellements that I aded like the favicon and the reset css and some other things.
