# Umbrella
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and memorable.
It is called the Umbrella project because of the idea of making something better without changing it. (when it rains, you pull up your Umbrella to make it better but it is still raining.)


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code, I found it hard to reed because it wasnt comented, had some bugs, and it was preatty messy.
THEN I find semantic HTML elements to be mising, so I change that in order to make it easyer to read.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
